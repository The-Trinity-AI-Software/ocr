paddleocr depends on paddlepaddle, ensure CPU version is used (paddlepaddle==2.5.2) unless using GPU.
deepface internally may use tensorflow, but you're currently not depending on it explicitly due to insightface usage.
Need to install system packages like poppler for pdf2image:
sudo apt-get install poppler-utils  # Linux
brew install poppler                # macOS
